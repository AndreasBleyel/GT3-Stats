# GT3-Stats

A web-scraper to analyse the frequency of cars used at the GT3 races at Racedepartment.com
It iterates over all threads in the RD forum and filters the GT3 races. From those threads, the
list of assigned cars gets extracted and saved as JSON. This JSON file was then manually analysed 
and chart metrics got created. The results were postet at the RD forums.
